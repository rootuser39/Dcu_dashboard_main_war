Deployment Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the EC2 Instance
1.1 Launch an EC2 Instance
Log into AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 and launch a new instance using an AMI with a pre-installed JDK and Apache Tomcat (e.g., an Amazon Linux AMI).
Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.medium) and configure the instance details.
Add storage as needed and configure security groups to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 and 8443 (for HTTP and HTTPS traffic).
Review and launch the instance, then create and download a key pair (e.g., my-key.pem).
1.2 Connect to Your Instance
Change the permissions of the key file:
bash
Copy code
chmod 400 /path/to/my-key.pem
Connect to your instance via SSH:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/my-key.pem ec2-user@ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Step 2: Configure Apache Tomcat
2.1 Install Apache Tomcat (if not pre-installed)
Download Tomcat:
bash
Copy code
wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.XX/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.XX.tar.gz
Extract the tar file:
bash
Copy code
tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.XX.tar.gz
Move the extracted directory to a suitable location:
bash
Copy code
sudo mv apache-tomcat-9.0.XX /opt/tomcat9
2.2 Update Permissions
Make scripts executable:
bash
Copy code
sudo chmod +x /opt/tomcat9/bin/*.sh
Step 3: Deploy WAR File
3.1 Upload the WAR File
Use SCP to upload the WAR file from your local machine to the EC2 instance:
bash
Copy code
scp -i /path/to/my-key.pem /path/to/your-application.war ec2-user@ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/opt/tomcat9/webapps
3.2 Start Tomcat Server
Navigate to the Tomcat bin directory:
bash
Copy code
cd /opt/tomcat9/bin
Start the Tomcat server:
bash
Copy code
./startup.sh
Step 4: Verify Deployment
Open a web browser and navigate to http://ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/your-application. Replace "XX-XXX-XXX-XXX" with your actual EC2 instance's public IP address and "your-application" with the name of your WAR file without the .war extension.
Troubleshooting
Check Tomcat logs in /opt/tomcat9/logs for errors.
Ensure security groups and network ACLs allow traffic on the required ports.
